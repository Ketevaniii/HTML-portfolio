<h1>About me</h1>
 <p>
  Hello! My name is Ketevani and I just graduated from high school. I went to number one school nation wide - Komarovi campus school.
 </p>
 <p>
  I started coding a few days ago and I think I am catching on well. I started studying because I got into Bachelors in CS (Computer Science) and I kind of had to learn so that it will be easier at the university.
 </p>

  Anyway, I hope it will come out well. 
 </p>
 <p>Good luck to everyone!</p>
